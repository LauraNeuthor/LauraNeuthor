    "text": "Hello! My name is Laura Neuthor and I am a currently a Student of the Master European Studies at Europa-University Viadrina. I have a Law Background, as I studied Business Law at Berlin School of Economics and Law in my undergraduate studies, but am especially passionate about building an interdisciplinary profile to tackle issues on the edge between Economics, Law and Politics. To work towards that goal, I also decided to pursue a second Bachelor’s Degree in Economics, which I currently study next to my main program.\nFor my future job, the most important thing to me is to make the world a little better for people around the world through my work. I am especially interested in the very diverse fields of climate protection and adaptation, peace building, anti-corruption and human rights protection.\nI very much enjoy acquiring new knowledge or building new skills which help me to understand the world better. That is why I participated at several summer courses, e.g. the Applied Peace and Conflict Studies Programme at Viadrina University, a course on the European Directive for Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence and on European Politics.\nI so far had the amazing opportunities to intern and work at (amongst others) the German Federal Foreign Office and the World Bank. I hope to continue working in International Cooperation in the future.\nYou can find more Information on my education and work experience in my CV. Reading some of my Blog Entries might also give you a better understanding of who I am."
